# Bio
My name is Nanqinqin Li (pronunciation: nan-CHING-ching, Chinese: 李南沁沁). I am a first-year Ph.D. student at Princeton University, working on systems research in [Princeton SNS Group](https://sns.princeton.edu/). I received my M.S. degree from the University of Chicago where I worked with [Prof. Haryadi Gunawi](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~haryadi/) on combating the notorious tail latency problem of solid-state drives. I got my B.Eng degree from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications.

# Research interests
I am broadly interested in building fast, robust systems. Currently, I am working on cloud/serverless computing research with emerging storage technologies (e.g., disaggregated storage).
